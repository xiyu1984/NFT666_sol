# Solidity Smart Contract For NFT666

## Description
Something interesting will be happened in metaverse, but the current standard for non-fungible tokens may not be able to adapt to some interesting situations. For example, if someone wants to lend an exceptionally valuable digital asset in the virtual world, to a friend, the existing standards do not guarantee that his friend will return it.

I believe that in the future metaverse world, the rental of digital assets is a very common situation, so I am ready to study how to provide a better service based on the existing NFT standard.

First, I'll try make NFT666 from ERC721(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

## Getting started
